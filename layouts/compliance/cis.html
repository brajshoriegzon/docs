                Pulumi can assist with making your organization's cloud infrastructure CIS compliant.
                CIS compliance adheres to the security benchmarks and guidelines provided by the
                Center for Internet Security (CIS). CIS compliance is an important step toward enhancing your organization's overall
                security posture by providing a solid foundation of best practices and configurations. 
                Ensuring that your {{ .Params.full }} is CIS compliant involves
                configuring your resources according to the
                <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark.html">
                    CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark.
                </a>
                This benchmark provides best practices for securing various AWS services,
                focusing on identity and access management, logging, monitoring, and
                networking.

            <h3>Key Components of CIS Compliance</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Implementation of Controls:</strong> Start by implementing the
                    CIS Controls relevant to your organization's size and risk profile.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Use CIS Benchmarks:</strong> Configure your systems and
                    applications according to CIS Benchmarks.

                <li>
                    <strong>Regular Audits:</strong> Continuously monitor and audit your
                    systems to ensure ongoing compliance with CIS recommendations.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Automation Tools:</strong> Consider using CIS-CAT (CIS
                    Configuration Assessment Tool) or other automation tools to assess and
                    enforce compliance across your infrastructure.
                </li>
            </ul>
