                Pulumi can assist with making your organization's cloud infrastructure become PCI-DSS compliant.
                PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) compliance refers to the adherence to a set of
                security standards designed
                to protect card information during and after a financial transaction. These standards are established by
                the Payment Card Industry
                Security Standards Council (PCI SSC), which was founded by major credit card companies like Visa,
                MasterCard, American Express,
                Discover, and JCB.

            <h3>Key Aspects of PCI-DSS Compliance:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Security Controls:</strong> Organizations must implement
                    specific technical and operational security measures to safeguard
                    cardholder data. This includes requirements like installing
                    firewalls, encrypting cardholder data, and using antivirus software.
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <strong>Access Control:</strong> Only authorized personnel should
                    have access to cardholder data. This involves setting up strong
                    access control measures, such as unique user IDs and restricting
                    physical access to sensitive data.
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <strong>Monitoring and Testing:</strong> Regularly monitor and test
                    networks to ensure that security controls are functioning correctly
                    and to identify vulnerabilities. This includes maintaining logs of
                    all access to network resources and cardholder data.
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <strong>Information Security Policy:</strong> Organizations must
                    maintain a policy that addresses information security for employees
                    and contractors. This includes regular security awareness training.
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <strong>Regular Audits:</strong> Organizations that process, store,
                    or transmit credit card information must undergo regular audits to
                    ensure they are in compliance with PCI-DSS requirements. This can
                    involve self-assessment or external assessments, depending on the
                    size of the organization and the volume of transactions processed.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                To make your {{  .Params.full }} PCI-DSS compliant, you need to
                implement a range of security measures and controls across your
                environment. Here's a checklist of what you should consider:
            </p>
            <h4>1. Network Security</h4>
        
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Firewall Configuration:</strong> Ensure that your {{  .Params.full }}
                    is behind a firewall. Use AWS Security Groups and Network
                    Access Control Lists (NACLs) to restrict inbound and outbound
                    traffic to only what is necessary.
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <strong>Segmentation:</strong> Isolate the cardholder data
                    environment (CDE) from other parts of your network. This can involve
                    creating a VPC with subnets dedicated to your CDE.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2. Data Protection</h4>
        
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Encryption:</strong> Encrypt cardholder data both at rest
                    and in transit. Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage
                    encryption keys. For data in transit, ensure that HTTPS (TLS) is
                    used.
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <strong>Storage:</strong> Limit the storage of cardholder data to
                    only what is absolutely necessary, and ensure that data is securely
                    deleted when no longer needed.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3. Access Control</h4>
        
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>User Access Management:</strong> Restrict access to the {{  .Params.full }}
                    and the data it processes to only those individuals who
                    need it. Use IAM roles with the principle of least privilege.
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Enable MFA for
                    all administrative access to the {{  .Params.full }} and AWS Management
                    Console.
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <strong>Unique IDs:</strong> Ensure that each user with access to
                    the {{  .Params.full }} or payment processing system has a unique ID.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>4. Monitoring and Logging</h4>
        
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Logging:</strong> Enable CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and AWS
                    Config to monitor and log access to your {{  .Params.full }} and its
                    network traffic. Ensure that logs are kept secure and are retained
                    as per PCI-DSS requirements.
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <strong>File Integrity Monitoring:</strong> Implement file integrity
                    monitoring to alert you to any unauthorized changes to critical
                    files or configurations.
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <strong>Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> Regularly scan your {{  .Params.full }}
                    for vulnerabilities using a PCI-approved scanning vendor (ASV).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>5. Secure Software Development</h4>
        
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Secure Coding Practices:</strong> Follow secure coding
                    practices to avoid vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site
                    scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <strong>Patching and Updates:</strong> Regularly update your {{  .Params.full }}
                    and any dependencies to ensure they are protected against known vulnerabilities.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>6. Policy and Documentation</h4>
        
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Information Security Policy:</strong> Develop and maintain
                    an information security policy that includes processes for PCI-DSS
                    compliance.
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> Establish an incident
                    response plan to address potential security breaches.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>7. Regular Audits</h4>
        
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Internal Audits:</strong> Perform regular internal audits of
                    your systems and processes to ensure they align with PCI-DSS
                    requirements.
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <strong>External Assessments:</strong> Depending on your transaction
                    volume, you may need to have an external Qualified Security Assessor
                    (QSA) conduct a formal PCI-DSS assessment.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>8. Vendor Management</h4>
        
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> Ensure that any
                    third-party service providers you use for payment processing or
                    storage are also PCI-DSS compliant.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>9. Physical Security</h4>
        
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Physical Security:</strong> AWS data centers themselves
                    are compliant with PCI-DSS physical security requirements, but you
                    should be aware of how to secure any backups or data that might be
                    stored outside of AWS.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>10. Documentation and Reporting</h4>
        
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Maintain Compliance Documentation:</strong> Keep records of
                    your compliance efforts, including policies, logs, and audit
                    reports.
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <strong>PCI-DSS SAQ:</strong> Depending on your level of PCI
                    compliance, complete the appropriate Self-Assessment Questionnaire
                    (SAQ) and submit it if necessary.
